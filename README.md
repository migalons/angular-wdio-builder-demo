# AngularWdioBuilderDemo

This project is intended to show how to include your e2e test developed using [webdriver.io](http://webdriver.io) framework, into angular workspace, so you can integrate these test into angular lifecycle, replacing protractor test.

For enabling this, it includes a custom angular builder: [@migalons/angular-wdio-builder](http://github.com/migalons/angular-wdio-builder)


_This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.5._

## Running end-to-end tests
